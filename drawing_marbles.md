A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

Solution:
It is an example of **Conditional Probability**.
If events A and B are not independent, then we must consider the probability that both events occur.
P(A) = 3/7 (certainly happened)
P(A ∩ B) = 3/7 . 4/6 ( probability of the intersection of the two events)
then P(B/A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A) = (2/7) / (3/7) = 2/3 (answer)
