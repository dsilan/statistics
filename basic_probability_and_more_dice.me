** In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9. **
 
Probability of their sum > 9:
6/36 = 1/6 ----> ( {6,6}, {5,6}, {6,5}, {6,4}, {4,6}, {5,5} )
1 - 1/6 = 5/6 (answer)

**In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.
{1, 5}, {5,1}, {2,4}, {4,2}
4/36 = 1/9 (answer)
